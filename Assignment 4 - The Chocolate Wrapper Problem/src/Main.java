// Description of the Chocolate Wrapper problem:
	// Suppose that:

		// You have 'initialMoney' dollars
		// Every chocolate bar costs 'barCost' dollars
		// Every chocolate bar has a single wrapper
		// Every 'exchangeWrappers'-many wrappers can be exchanged for a new chocolate bar.

	// If you start with initialMoney, repeatedly eat every chocolate bar and exchange all possible 
	// wrappers for more chocolate bars, how many chocolate Bars do you eat in total?

// See the Assignment itself for more details and some sample outputs.
